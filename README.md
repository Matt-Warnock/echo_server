## How to use this project

This is a Ruby project. Tell your Ruby version manager to set your local Ruby version to the one specified in the `Gemfile`.

For example, if you are using [rbenv](https://cbednarski.com/articles/installing-ruby/):

1. Install the right Ruby version:
  ```bash
  rbenv install < VERSION >
  ```
1. Move to the root directory of this project and type:
  ```bash
  rbenv local < VERSION >
  ruby -v
  ```

You will also need to install the `bundler` gem, which will allow you to install the rest of the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` file of this project.

```bash
gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
